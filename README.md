# What is this project?
https://www.aptero.co
In our previous workplaces, we were [wasting](http://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/the-ugly-truth-about-meetings_538ca71ea5358_w580.jpg) everyday incredible amount of time to setup meetings and making sure everyone could join. 
We had remote colleagues dropping off, and often everyone was multitasking during meetings.

That's why by combining the convenience of online meetings with the interactivity of face-to-face meetings, we can create virtual workspaces where you can collaborate, create and feel truly together with colleagues.

# Aptero VR
We made a whole innovative tutorial that help fellow developers build with Facebook technologies!
Here's the tutorial and commented code!

# Aptero VR
![Aptero](https://hub.aptero.co/data/data/Cedric/facebook/facebook.JPG)

A collaborative VR space for creative meeting with 3d sketch made with react360.  
The app is composed of a client (Aptero_Client) and a server (Aptero_Server).  

With Aptero, you'll have access to powerful meetings in interactive VR spaces, enabling remotely to review products and 3D models, brainstorm, sketch, mind-map, prototype and have team-building activities. 


## To start developping on the client run
yarn install  
yarn run start  
Note that the client in a dev mode will conect to the server on localhost:6767 so you also have to run the server in dev mode.  
Open browser at http://localhost:8081/index.html to see the result.  

## to start develloping on the server run 
yarn install  
yarn run start
