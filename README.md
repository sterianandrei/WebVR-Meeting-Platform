# Aptero VR

A collaborative VR space for creative meeting with 3d sketch made with react360.  
The app is composed of a client (Aptero_Client) and a server (Aptero_Server).  

With Aptero, you'll have access to powerful meetings in interactive VR spaces, enabling remotely to review products and 3D models, brainstorm, sketch, mind-map, prototype and have team-building activities.

Note that the client in a dev mode will conect to the server on localhost:6767 so you also have to run the server in dev mode.
